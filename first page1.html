<br><p style="font-size:19px;"><font color="Arial">Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language that has become one of the most popular technologies in the software industry. It was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and officially released in 1995. The primary goal behind Java’s development was to create a language that could run on any device without modification.<B> This led to the famous Java philosophy</B></font>.<br>

<B><p style="font-size:19px;color:black;">History of Java:</B>
<br><p style="front-family:Times New Roman;font-size:19px;color:slategray;">
Java began as a project called Oak in 1991. The original purpose was to develop software for electronic devices such as set-top boxes and televisions. Later, the project evolved into a powerful programming language focused on the internet, and the name was changed to Java in 1995. With its secure architecture and portable nature, Java quickly became popular for web applications, enterprise systems, and mobile development. In 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and became the official owner of Java.<br>
