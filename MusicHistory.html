        Indian music has a rich and spiritual history rooted in ancient traditions.
        It originated from the Vedas and evolved into classical forms like
        Hindustani and Carnatic music.

        <br><br>

        Indian classical music focuses on <b>Raga</b> and <b>Tala</b>, expressing
        deep emotions, devotion, and storytelling through sound.

        <br><br>

        Folk music reflects regional culture, festivals, and daily life,
        while film music brought Indian sounds to the global stage.

        <br><br>

        Today, Indian music blends tradition with modern genres like pop,
        fusion, and electronic music, influencing audiences worldwide.
